/// \brief The ezFileSystem provides high-level functionality to manage files in a virtual file system.
///
/// There are two sides at which the file system can be extended:
/// Data directories are the 'sources' of data. These can be simple folders, zip files, data-bases, HTTP servers, etc.
/// Different ezDataDirectoryType's can implement these different 'decoding methods', i.e. they handle how to actually
/// access the data and they use their own readers/writers to implement a common interface for passing data streams
/// to and from the data directory.
/// On the other end there are the actual file readers/writers, which implement policies how to optimize these reads/writes.
/// The default ezFileReader and ezFileWriter implement a buffering policy, i.e. they use an internal cache to only
/// sporadically read or write to the actual data stream.
/// A 'threaded' or 'parallel' file reader/writer could implement a different policy, where a file is read/written
/// in a thread and thus allows to have non-blocking file accesses.
///
/// Which policy to use is defined by the user every time he needs to access a file, by simply using the desired
/// reader/writer class.
/// How to mount data directories (i.e. with which ezDataDirectoryType) is defined by the 'DataDirFactories', which
/// are functions that create ezDataDirectoryType's. This way one can mount the same data directory (e.g. "MyTestDir")
/// differently, depending on which Factories have been registered previously.
/// This allows to easily configure how to set up data directories.
/// E.g. by default ordinary folders will be mounted to be read from the local file system.
/// However, by registering a different Factory, the same directory could also be mounted over a network on a remote
/// file serving machine.
///
/// Additionally ezFileSystem also broadcasts events about which files are (about to be) accessed.
/// This allows to hook into the system and implement stuff like automatic asset transformations before/after certain
/// file accesses, checking out files from revision control systems, or simply logging all file activity.
///
/// All operations that go through the ezFileSystem are protected by a mutex, which means that opening, closing, deleting
/// files, as well as adding or removing data directories etc. will be synchronized and cannot happen in parallel.
/// Reading/writing file streams can happen in parallel, only the administrative tasks need to be protected.
/// File events are broadcast as they occur, that means they will be executed on whichever thread triggered them.
/// Since they are executed from within the filesystem mutex, they cannot occur in parallel.

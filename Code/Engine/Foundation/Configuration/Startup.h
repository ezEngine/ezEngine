/// \brief The startup system makes sure to initialize and shut down all known subsystems in the proper order.
///
/// Each subsystem can define on which other subsystems (or entire group) it is dependent (i.e. which other code it needs in an initialized
/// state, before it can run itself). The startup system will sort all subsystems by their dependencies and then initialize
/// them in the proper order.
/// The startup and shutdown sequence consists of two steps. First the 'core' functionality is initialized. This is usually
/// all the functionality that does not depend on a working rendering context.
/// After all systems have had their 'core' functionality initialized, the 'high level' functionality can be initialized.
/// In between these steps the rendering context should be created.
/// Tools that might not create a window or do not want to actually load GPU resources, might get away with only doing
/// the 'core' initialization. Thus a subsystem should do all the initialization that is independent from a window or rendering
/// context in 'core' startup, and it should be able to work (with some features disabled), even when 'high level' startup is not done.
///
/// A subsystem startup configuration for a static subsystem needs to be put in some cpp file of the subsystem and looks like this:
///
/// // clang-format off
/// EZ_BEGIN_SUBSYSTEM_DECLARATION(ExampleGroup, ExampleSubSystem)
///
///   BEGIN_SUBSYSTEM_DEPENDENCIES
///     "SomeOtherSubSystem",
///     "SomeOtherSubSystem2",
///     "SomeGroup"
///   END_SUBSYSTEM_DEPENDENCIES
///
///   ON_CORESYSTEMS_STARTUP
///   {
///     ezExampleSubSystem::BasicStartup();
///   }
///
///   ON_CORESYSTEMS_SHUTDOWN
///   {
///     ezExampleSubSystem::BasicShutdown();
///   }
///
///   ON_HIGHLEVELSYSTEMS_STARTUP
///   {
///     ezExampleSubSystem::EngineStartup();
///   }
///
///   ON_HIGHLEVELSYSTEMS_SHUTDOWN
///   {
///     ezExampleSubSystem::EngineShutdown();
///   }
///
/// EZ_END_SUBSYSTEM_DECLARATION;
/// // clang-format on
///
/// This will automatically register the subsystem, once the code is being loaded (can be dynamically loaded from a DLL).
/// The next time any of the ezStartup functions are called (StartupCoreSystems, StartupHighLevelSystems) the subsystem will be initialized.
///
/// If however your subsystem is implemented as a normal class, you need to derive from the base class 'ezSubSystem' and
/// override the virtual functions. Then when you have an instance of that class and call ezStartup::StartupCore etc., that
/// instance will be properly initialized as well. However, you must ensure that the subsystem is properly shut down, before
/// its instance is destroyed. Also you should never have two instances of the same subsystem.
///
/// All startup / shutdown procedures broadcast global events before and after they execute.

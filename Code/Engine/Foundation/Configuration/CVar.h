/// while the application is running.
/// It is very easy and convenient to temporarily add a CVar while some code is in development, to be able to try out different
/// approaches. However, one should throw out all unnecessary variables after such work is finished.
/// CVars are stored in one settings file per plugin. That means plugins can easily contain additional CVars for their own use
/// and their states are restored at plugin loading time, as well.
/// For the storage of CVars to work, the 'StorageFolder' must have been set. Also at startup the application should explicitly
/// load CVars via 'LoadCVars', once the filesystem is set up and the storage folder is configured.
/// The CVar system listens to events from the Plugin system, and it will automatically take care to serialize and deserialize
/// CVar values whenever plugins are loaded or unloaded.
/// CVars additionally allow to only change their visible value after a certain subsystem has been 'restarted', i.e. a user can
/// change the CVar value at runtime, but when the 'current' value is read, it will not have changed.
/// It will change however, once the application is restarted (such that code can initialize the engine with the correct values)
/// or after the corresponding subsystem explicitly sets the CVar to the updated value.
/// This is useful, e.g. for a screen resolution CVar, as changing this at runtime might be possible in a GUI, but the engine
/// might not support that without a restart.
/// Finally all CVars broadcast events when their value is changed, which can be used to listen to certain CVars and react
/// properly when their value changes.

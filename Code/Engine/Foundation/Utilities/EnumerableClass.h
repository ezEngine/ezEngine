/// \brief Base class to add the ability to another class to enumerate all active instance of it, across DLL boundaries.
///
/// This creates a new class-type that has the static information
/// about all instances that were created from that class. Another class now only has to derive from that class and will
/// then gain the ability to count and enumerate its instances.
///
/// Usage is as follows:
///
/// If you have a class A that you want to be enumerable, add this to its header:
///
///   class EZ_DLL_IMPORT_EXPORT_STUFF A : public ezEnumerable<A>
///   {
///     EZ_DECLARE_ENUMERABLE_CLASS(A); // since A is declared as DLL import/export all code embedded in its body will also work properly
///     ...
///   };
///
/// Also add this somewhere in its source-file:
///
///   EZ_ENUMERABLE_CLASS_IMPLEMENTATION(A);
///
/// That's it, now the class instances can be enumerated with 'GetFirstInstance' and 'GetNextInstance'

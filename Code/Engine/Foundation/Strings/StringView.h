/// Attention: ezStringView does not store string data itself. It only stores pointers into memory. For example,
/// when you get an ezStringView to an ezStringBuilder, the ezStringView instance will point to the exact same memory,
/// enabling you to iterate over it (read-only).
/// That means that an ezStringView is only valid as long as its source data is not modified. Once you make any kind
/// of modification to the source data, you should not continue using the ezStringView to that data anymore,
/// as it might now point into invalid memory.

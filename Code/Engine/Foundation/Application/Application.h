/// The platform abstraction layer will ensure that the correct functions are called independent of the basic main loop structure
/// (traditional or event-based). Derive an application specific class from ezApplication and implement at least the abstract Run()
/// function. Additional virtual functions allow to hook into specific events to run application specific code at the correct times.
///
/// Finally pass the name of your derived class to one of the macros EZ_APPLICATION_ENTRY_POINT() or EZ_CONSOLEAPP_ENTRY_POINT().
/// Those are used to abstract away the platform specific code to run an application.
///
/// A simple example how to get started is as follows:
///
/// \code{.cpp}
///   class ezSampleApp : public ezApplication
///   {
///   public:
///
///     virtual void AfterCoreSystemsStartup() override
///     {

///     }
///
///     virtual void BeforeCoreSystemsShutdown() override
///     {
///       // Close log file, etc.
///     }
///
///     virtual ezApplication::ApplicationExecution Run() override
///     {
///       // Either run a one-time application (e.g. console script) and return ezApplication::Quit
///       // Or run one update (frame) of your game loop and return ezApplication::Continue

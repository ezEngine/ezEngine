/// ***** Assert Usage Guidelines *****
///
/// For your typical code, use EZ_ASSERT_DEV to check that vital preconditions are met.
/// Be aware that EZ_ASSERT_DEV is removed in non-development builds (ie. when EZ_COMPILE_FOR_DEVELOPMENT is disabled),
/// INCLUDING your code in the assert condition.
/// If the code that you are checking must be executed, even in non-development builds, use EZ_VERIFY instead.
/// EZ_ASSERT_DEV and EZ_VERIFY will trigger a breakpoint in debug builds, but will not interrupt the application
/// in release builds.
///
/// For conditions that are rarely violated or checking is very costly, use EZ_ASSERT_DEBUG. This assert is only active
/// in debug builds. This allows to have extra checking while debugging a program, but not waste performance when a
/// development release build is used.
///
/// If you need to check something that is so vital that the application can only fail (i.e. crash), if that condition
/// is not met, even in release builds, then use EZ_ASSERT_RELEASE. This should not be used in frequently executed code,
/// as it is not stripped from non-development builds by default.
///
/// If you need to squeeze the last bit of performance out of your code, EZ_ASSERT_RELEASE can be disabled, by defining
/// EZ_DISABLE_RELEASE_ASSERTS.
/// Please be aware that EZ_ASSERT_RELEASE works like the other asserts, i.e. once it is deactivated, the code in the condition
/// is not executed anymore.
///

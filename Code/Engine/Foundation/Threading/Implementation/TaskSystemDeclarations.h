/// \brief Describes the priority with which to execute a task.
///
/// For tasks that you start this frame and that need to finish within the same frame,
/// use 'EarlyThisFrame', 'ThisFrame' or 'LateThisFrame'.\n
/// However you should generally not rely on starting tasks in the same frame in which they need to finish.\n
/// Instead prefer to start a task, whose result you need in the next frame or even later.\n
/// For those tasks, use 'EarlyNextFrame', 'NextFrame', 'LateNextFrame' and 'InNFrames'.\n
/// Once 'ezTaskSystem::FinishFrameTasks' is called, all those tasks will be moved into the 'XYZThisFrame' categories.\n
/// For tasks that run over a longer period (e.g. path searches, procedural data creation), use 'LongRunning'.
/// Only use 'LongRunningHighPriority' for tasks that occur rarely, otherwise 'LongRunning' tasks might not get processed, at all.\n
/// For tasks that need to access files, prefer to use 'FileAccess', this way all file accesses get executed sequentially.\n
/// Use 'FileAccessHighPriority' to get very important file accesses done sooner. For example writing out a save-game should finish
/// quickly.\n For tasks that need to execute on the main thread (e.g. uploading GPU resources) use 'ThisFrameMainThread' or
/// 'SomeFrameMainThread' depending on how urgent it is. 'SomeFrameMainThread' tasks might get delayed for quite a while, depending on the
/// system load. For tasks that need to do several things (e.g. reading from a file AND uploading something on the main thread), split them
/// up into several tasks that depend on each other (or just let the first task start the next step once it is finished). There is no
/// guarantee WHEN (within a frame) main thread tasks get executed. Most of them will get executed upon a 'FinishFrameTasks' call. However
/// they are also run whenever the main thread needs to wait or cancel some other task and has nothing else to do. So tasks that get
/// executed on the main thread should never assume a certain state of other systems.

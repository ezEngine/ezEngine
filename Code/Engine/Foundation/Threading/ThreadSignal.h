/// \brief Waiting on a thread signal puts the waiting thread to sleep. Other threads can wake it up by raising the signal.
///
/// ezThreadSignal is similar to ezConditionVariable but adds some internal state, which makes it more suitable for common use cases.
/// For instance, in contrast to ezConditionVariable, one can wait for an ezThreadSignal and get awoken, even if the signal was raised
/// before a thread tried to wait on it.
/// At any given time the thread signal is either 'raised' or 'cleared'. Waiting for a 'raised' signal will return immediately.
/// This makes it easier to implement a simple producer/consumer scenario.
///
/// Once a waiting thread is woken up, the signal state is cleared automatically, unless the ezThreadSignal uses 'ManualReset' mode.
/// Thus, in AutoReset mode, it is guaranteed that exactly one thread will be woken up (or not even put to sleep) for every signal.
///
/// If an already raised ezThreadSignal is raised again, this has no effect.

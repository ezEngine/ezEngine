/// \brief This system allows to automatically distribute tasks onto a number of worker threads.
///
/// By deriving from ezTask you can create your own task types. These can be executed through this task system.
/// You can run a single task using the 'StartSingleTask' function. For more complex setups, it is possible
/// to create groups of tasks, which can have interdependencies. This should be used to group all
/// tasks that belong to one system and need to be done before another system runs. For example you could group
/// all tasks to update particle systems, and then have another group for all tasks to update sound, which depends
/// on the first group, such that sound is only updated after all particle systems are done with.
///
/// Although it is possible to wait for tasks or to cancel them, it is generally advised to try to minimize their use.
/// Tasks that might need to be canceled regularly (e.g. path searches) should be implemented in a way that they
/// are aware of being canceled and will stop their work prematurely, instead of running through to the end.
///
/// Note that it is crucial to call 'FinishFrameTasks' once per frame, otherwise tasks that need to be executed on the
/// main thread are never executed.

  /// to guarantee some progress.

/// \brief Condition variables are used to put threads to sleep and wake them up upon certain events
///
/// The ezConditionVariable works in conjunction with a mutex. When waiting for a signal,
/// the OS typically puts the waiting thread to sleep.
/// Using SignalOne() or SignalAll() other threads can wake up one or all threads that are
/// currently waiting on the condition variable.
///
/// When a thread is woken up, it automatically holds the lock on the condition variable's mutex,
/// which can be used to safely access or modify certain state.
///
/// ezConditionVariable is a low-level threading construct. Higher level functionality such as
/// ezThreadSignal may be more suitable for most use cases.

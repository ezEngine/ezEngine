/// \brief A loose Octree implementation that is very lightweight on RAM.
///
/// This Octree does not store any bookkeeping information per node.\n
/// Memory usage is linear in the number of objects inserted.\n
/// An empty tree only needs few bytes. This is accomplished by making the tree
/// static in it's dimensions and maximum subdivisions, such that each node can be assigned
/// a unique index. A map is then used to store objects through the node-index in
/// which they are located.\n
/// At traversals each node's bounding-box needs to be computed on-the-fly thus adding some
/// CPU overhead (though, fewer memory use usually also means fewer cache-misses).
/// \n
/// Inserting an object is O(log d), with d being the tree-depth.\n
/// Removing an object is either O(1) or O(n), with n being the number of objects inserted,
/// depending on whether an iterator to the object is available.\n
/// \n
/// The nodes get indices in such a way that when it is detected, that a whole subtree is
/// visible, all objects can be returned quickly, without further traversal.\n
/// If a subtree does not contain any data, traversal is not continued further, either.\n
/// \n
/// In general this octree implementation is made to be very flexible and easily usable for
/// many kinds of problems. All it stores are two integers for an object (GroupID, InstanceID).
/// The object data itself must be stored somewhere else. You can easily store very different
/// types of objects in the same tree.\n
/// Once objects are inserted, you can do range queries to find all objects in some location.
/// Since removal is usually O(1) and insertion is O(d) the tree can be used for very dynamic
/// data that changes frequently at run-time.

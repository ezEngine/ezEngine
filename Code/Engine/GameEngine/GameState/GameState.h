/// \brief ezGameState implements the ezGameStateBase interface and adds several convenience features.
///
/// For an explanation what game states are, see the online documentation:
/// https://ezengine.net/pages/docs/runtime/application/game-state.html
///
/// The ezGameState adds some default functionality:
/// * Creation of a main window and render pipeline
/// * A main view handle
/// * A main camera object
/// * A main world that is currently active
/// * Background loading of scenes
/// * A separate world used as a loading screen
/// * automatic player prefab spawning if a ezPlayerStartPointComponent is part of the scene
/// * automatically applies the state of the "Main View" ezCameraComponent in the scene
/// * Many additional hooks to customize only specific parts, such as the window creation
///
/// Typically you would derive from ezGameState and then override functions like
/// `ProcessInput()` and `ConfigureMainCamera()`. Take a look at `ezFallbackGameState` for inspiration.

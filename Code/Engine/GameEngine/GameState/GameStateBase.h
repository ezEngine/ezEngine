/// \brief ezGameState is the base class to build custom game logic upon. It works closely together with ezGameApplication.
///
/// In a typical game there is always exactly one instance of an ezGameState derived class active.
/// The game state handles custom game logic, which must be handled outside ezWorld, custom components and scripts.
///
/// For example a custom implementation of ezGameState may handle how to show a menu, when to switch to
/// another level, how multi-player works, or which player information is transitioned from one level to the next.
/// It's main purpose is to implement high-level game logic.
///
/// ezGameApplication will loop through all available ezGameState implementations and ask each available one
/// whether it can handle a certain level. Each game state returns a 'priority' how well it can handle the game.
///
/// In a typical game you only have one game state linked into the binary, so in that case there is no reason for
/// such a system. However, in an editor you might have multiple game states available through plugins, but
/// only one can take control.
/// In such a case, each game state may inspect the given world and check whether it is e.g. a single-player
/// or multi-player level, or whether it uses it's own game specific components, and then decide whether
/// it is the best fit for that level.
///
/// \note Do not forget to reflect your derived class, otherwise ezGameApplication may not find it.

/// \brief Implements an input device abstraction on top of the SFML library.
///
/// Unfortunately SFML does neither support relative mouse motion, nor clipping a mouse cursor to the window area.
/// Thus relative and absolute mouse position are 'emulated' by this device. As a consequence, relative mouse motion
/// only works without limits, when the mouse cursor is clipped (in that case it is reset to the window center after each
/// movement).
///
/// SFML has several other limitations, as well. For example keyboard input is not language setting independent.
/// To see the effect, just try out what different things happen when you use an English, German and Russian language setting :-(
/// Therefore, it is highly advised to make all key-mappings configurable, such that users with other language settings can
/// 'fix' this on their end.
///
/// Also many special keys are not properly supported by SFML, most notably Numpad Enter is handled like Return.

  /// retrieving the absolute mouse position from the input device still works as expected.

/// \brief The base class for all input device types.
///
/// An input device is the abstraction of one or more types of input. It is not linked to one physical device.
/// For example an input device can represent mouse AND keyboard (through one class). Another input device
/// can represent all connected controllers (e.g. up to 4 XBox 360 controllers).
/// On OSes where applications can have several windows, an input device may also represent all input from one window, if required.
///
/// An input device is the abstraction layer for the hardware input. All keys, movements etc. are mapped to named 'input slots',
/// which typically hold a value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents 'not pressed' and 1 represents 'fully pressed'. All hardware
/// that has a finite range (such as buttons, analog triggers, the positive/negative axis of analog sticks) should try to map to this
/// range. Even mouse coordinates are typically mapped to the 0 to 1 range, where zero means top/left and 1 means bottom/right.
///
/// All input handling is usually handled through the ezInputManager class.
/// A user should typically not have to interact directly with an input device, unless he needs to call device specific functions
/// for advanced configuration.
///
/// An input device defines which input slots it exposes to the engine. All input slots are handled by name (e.g. string).
/// For example a keyboard would expose the input slots 'keyboard_a' to 'keyboard_z' and other keys. A mouse would expose slots
/// such as 'mouse_move_pos_x' and 'mouse_move_neg_x' etc.
///
/// By deriving from ezInputDevice you can extend what hardware the engine supports. The derived class should override
/// InitializeDevice() to do hardware specific setup. It also needs to override RegisterInputSlots() to register all the input slots
/// that it wants to expose from the hardware. E.g. if the device wants to expose values from a gyroscope, it should register
/// input slots that represent the rotations around the different axis (one slot each for both positive and negative changes).
/// It then also needs to implement UpdateInputSlotValues() and/or ResetInputSlotValues() and possible a device-specific update
/// function, to get the input values. For example on Windows a platform/device specific update function is necessary to parse
/// the incoming window messages. If such a device specific function is necessary, it also needs to be integrated into the proper
/// code (e.g. into the window handling code, to be able to get the window messages). In such a case it might not be possible
/// to add such a device purely through a dynamic plugin, but might also need deeper integration into other engine code.

  /// you can also just update the map whenever input arrives. However in such a use-case you sometimes need to manually

  /// the map. However, when the mouse stops usually no 'mouse stopped' message is sent but the values in the map need to be

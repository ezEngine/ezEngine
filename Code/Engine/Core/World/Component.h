  /// editor. If instead the sound gets started in OnSimulationStarted(), it will only play once the user starts the game mode inside the
  /// editor.
  ///
  /// Additionally, OnSimulationStarted() is only ever executed once on a component, even if the ezWorld pauses and resumes world simulation
  /// multiple times. Thus components that should only execute a thing exactly once, will work correctly. In contrast OnActivated() and
  /// OnDeactivated() will be executed every time the component's active state is toggled, which could re-execute the same behavior multiple

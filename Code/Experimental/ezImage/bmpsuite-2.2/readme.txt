This is a set of Windows BMP image files, and a utility for generating them.
Many different varieties of BMP files are included, and are intended to be
useful for testing.

Files in the "g" directory I consider to be "good": 
Your program should definitely support them if it claims to support BMP.

Files in the "q" directory I consider to be "questionable":
These may be really unusual, or technically violate the documentation in some
way, or I may be unsure about their validity.

Files in the "b" directory I consider to be "bad":
These are clearly invalid or unreasonable. Make sure your program doesn't crash
when reading them.

The individual BMP files are described in the html/bmpsuite.html file.

The generation utility is written in C, and is contained in the bmpsuite.c
file, and the files in the 'data' subdirectory. In a Unix-like environment,
type "make bmpsuite" to build the program, or just "make" to build and run it.
Run "make check" to verify that it writes the BMP files correctly.

/// \brief This component is for propagating the flow of power in cables or fluid in pipes and determine whether it arrives at a receiver.
///
/// This component is meant for building puzzles where you have to connect the right objects to power something.
/// It uses physics constraints to physically connect two pieces and have them snap together.
/// It also reacts to being grabbed (ezMsgObjectGrabbed) to disconnect.
///
/// On its own this component doesn't do anything.
/// However, it can be set to be 'connected' to another object with an ezPowerConnectorComponent, in which case it would propagate its own
/// 'output' as the 'input' on that component.
/// If its output is non-zero and thus the input on the connected component is also non-zero, the other component will post ezEventMsgSetPowerInput,
/// to which a script can react and for example switch a light on.
///
/// Connectors are bi-directional ("full duplex"), so they can have both an input and an output and the two values are independent of each other.
/// That means power can flow in both or just one direction and therefore it is not important with which end a cable gets connected to something.
///
/// To enable building things like cables, each ezPowerConnectorComponent can also have a 'buddy', which is an object on which another
/// ezPowerConnectorComponent exists.
/// If a connector gets input, that input value is propagated to the buddy as its output value. Thus when a cable gets input on one end,
/// the other end (if it is properly set as the buddy) will output that value. So if that end is also 'connected' to something, the output will
/// be further propagated as the 'input' on that object. This can go through many hops until the value reaches the final connector (if you build a
/// circular chain it will stop when it reaches the starting point).
///
/// The component automatically connects to another object when it receives a ezMsgSensorDetectedObjectsChanged, so it should have a child
/// object with a sensor. The sensor should use a dedicated spatial category to search for markers where it can connect.
///
/// To have a sensor (or other effects) only active when the connector is grabbed, put them in a child object with the name "ActiveWhenGrabbed"
/// and disable the object by default. The parent ezPowerConnectorComponent will toggle the active flag of that object when it gets grabbed or let go.
///
/// To build a cable, don't forget to set each end as the 'buddy' of the other end.

<ul>
<li>ezEditor now uses the <A HREF="https://github.com/githubuser0xFFFF/Qt-Advanced-Docking-System">Qt Advanced Docking System</A> for better window docking.
You can now simply drag document windows onto seperate screens and dock them with more flexibility.</li>
<li>Texture conversion now automatically dilates the color channel when an alpha mask is used. This can be disabled in the Texture Asset settings.</li>
<li>The 'Editor' project in Visual Studio now contains an 'Editor Data' folder which lists files such as this WhatsNew.txt and the localization files, to improve the workflow.</li>
<li>Added action <i>Tools > Open in Visual Studio Code</i> which will launch VS Code pointed at the project folder.</li>
</ul>

<H2>November 2018</H2>

<ul>
<li>You can now point at a position and execute 'Play From Here' to launch Play-the-Game mode and move the player object to the picked position. Has to be supported by the active game state.</li>
<li>It is now possible to expose array properties, e.g. from prefabs.</li>
<li>Exposing properties from nested prefabs works as well now.</li>
<li>It is now allowed to attach nodes to objects that already have a prefab component attached.</li>
</ul>

<H2>October 2018</H2>

<ul>

<li>Under <i>Editor > Project Settings > Asset Profiles</i> one can now add and configure different profiles for how assets are processed. The active profile can be changed dynamically and all assets will be reloaded. When running the ezPlayer, it will use the currently active asset profile from the editor.</li>
<li>The asset profile can also specify which render pipeline to use at runtime.</li>
<li>Camera components do not specify the render pipeline directly anymore, but instead use a 'Camera Config' which is specified through the asset profile.</li>
<li>New context menu action to create an empty node at the picked position.</li>
<li>Added support for trees created with <A HREF="http://www.artifactgames.de/Kraut/index.htm">Kraut</A></li>
</ul>

<H2>September 2018</H2>

<H4>Smaller Changes</H4>

<ul>

<li>A scene thumbnail can now be created through <i>Scene > Utilities > Create Scene Thumbnail</i>. The thumbnail position can be specified by placing a camera object with the 'Thumbnail' usage.</li>
<li>The editor now shows a "What's New" text in the project tab.</li>
<li>Menus in property grids are now searchable when they contain more than 10 items.</li>
<li>New scene documents are now populated with a dummy scene.</li>
<li>By default the scene tree is now expanded to the selected item on selection changes. This can be disabled in the editor preferences.</li>
<li>The greyboxing tool now uses the currently selected material from the asset browser for new objects.</li>
<li>Snap settings are now in a dialog, shortcut for the dialog is <b>End</b></li>

</ul>

<H4>Shortcut changes</H4>

The default shortcuts have been cleaned up a bit. Important changes:

<ul>

<li>Toggle Grid: <b>G</b></li>
<li>Toggle Shape Icons: <b>I</b></li>
<li>Toggle Visualizers: <b>V</b></li>
<li>Toggle Selection Highlights: <b>S</b></li>
<li>Transform Asset: <b>CTRL+E</b></li>
<li>Keep Simulation Changes: <b>K</b></li>
<li>Group Selected Objects: <b>CTRL+G</b></li>
<li>Snap to Grid: <b>CTRL+End</b></li>

</ul>

<H4>Editor Cameras</H4>

It is now possible to save the current camera position in a scene to the user preferences using <b>CTRL+Number</b>. The editor camera position can be restored again using the shortcut <b>Number</b>.

Additionally one can easily insert a camera object into the scene using <b>CTRL+ALT+Number</b> and move the editor camera to that position with <b>ALT+Number</b>. Since these cameras are stored within the scene, they can be used to share interesting camera positions with other users.

<H4>Keep Simulation Changes</H4>

Simulating the scene in the editor now allows to synchronize object positions back to the editor state. During simulation select objects and press <b>K</b> (or <i>Scene > Utilties > Keep Simulation Changes</i>). When simulation is stopped, the objects will move to the simulated position. Use <b>Undo</b> to discard all simulation changes again.

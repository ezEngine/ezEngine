# Source Asset Location

The source assets are stored here:

<https://github.com/ezEngine/src-assets>

## To update ezMesh files

The editor project is used to convert source assets from .glb format into the EZ specific formats.
The files from the AssetCache must then be copied here.

## To update OBJ files

Use Blender to export to OBJ.
See local Readme.md files for detailed instructions.
